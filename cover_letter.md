I'm an enthusiastic new developer ready to join a team where I can grow and help others do the same. With my background as an educator, facilitator, and group leader, I am happiest when I am helping others achieve interesting goals. I've focused on software engineering for two years, and two truths have emerged:

- I enjoy learning and solving problems
- I am a flexible and joyful student, apprentice, teammate

If your team will supply me with technical challenges and room to grow, it is ideal for me.

While it is no longer unusual for people to take non-traditional paths to software, I want to clear something up. _I didn't teach myself how to code._ Whether from books or the internet, structured MOOCs or seminars, no one is truly _self-taught_. Certain people come to mind; without them I would not be writing this. Most importantly, I've intentionally learned how to learn, and how _I_ learn. Mentorship, collaboration, and peer learning are vital.

- I love seeing the world from different viewpoints
- It is my goal to never stop refining myself, both as an engineer and an individual, and that requires challenge.

I want to work with diverse people on complicated projects that put me slightly outside of my comfort zone. This is where growth happens both for myself and those around me. Ideally, we will also solve some interesting problems along the way. If that sounds like what you need, I look forward to meeting you.
